# CRM_Django

This webpage is basically created to handle all the customer relationship data. Its a dynamic application integrated with mysql instead of going for the standard sqlite DB associated with Django.

Please do install the mysqlclient and connector. Make sure to start the mysql database as well.

Commands to handle GIT!

$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"

$ git config --global user.email "you@youraddress.com"

$ git config --global push.default matching

$ git config --global alias.co checkout

$ git init

$ git add .

$ git commit -am "Commit Name"

$ git push -u origin main

Using this application we will be able to add, delete and update records. This application also includes a login and registration page.

Cheers!! Happy Coding!
